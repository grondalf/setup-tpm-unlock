# setup-tpm-unlock
A bash script to enable or disable TPM2 LUKS unlock for Fedora.

## Installation 
- Place the script inside the `~/local/bin/` directory. Make sure the `PATH` is in your environmental variables.

- Make it executable:
```chmod +x ~/.local/bin/update-flatpak-aliases```

## Disclaimer
The script was made with the help of Deepseek's AI. While I have used it successfuly in Fedora Worksation, please check the source code before attempting to use in your own GNU/Linux device.
